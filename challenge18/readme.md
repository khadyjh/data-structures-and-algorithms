# Challenge Summary
create FizzBuzz method that take binary tree of int and return binary tree of string depending on if the int value  divisible by 3 or 5 or both


## Whiteboard Process


## Approach & Efficiency
|    method     | time complexity |  space complexity  |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|:------------------:|
| fizzBuzzTree  |      O(n)       |        O(n)        |


## Solution

fizzBuzzTree() => method take binary tree of int as argument and return binary tree of string as result using recursion approach
