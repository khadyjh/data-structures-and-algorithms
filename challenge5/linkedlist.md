# Singly Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes.

each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

Each node has data and a pointer to the next node.

## Challenge 5
Challenge 5 was about implement the linked list and some of its functions

## Approach & Efficiency

in this implementation some of methode take O(n) and Some take O(1) according to requirement

## API
1. insert method take one argument to insert it into the first of the linked list and take O(1) for time and space
2. includes method take one argument and return true if the linked list contain the argument and false if it not
3. toString method to format the output(linked list element ) before print it
